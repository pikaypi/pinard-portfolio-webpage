# Project 2 - My Professional Portfolio

This project is a webpage, built from scratch, to display and keep current my professional portfolio. The following criteria are require elements.
* Upon opening, the user finds my name, a recent picture, and a navigation bar to get them to sections about personal information, my portfolio, and my contact information
* The porfolio section should have the most recent project larger than the others
* The image for each project should take you to the deployed location of that project
* The layout should be reponsive to different viewport sizes

## Where it is
The link to this deployed project is here(https://pikaypi.github.io/pinard-portfolio-webpage/)

## What It Looks Like

## How it works
The links in the navigation bar redirect to each paragraph with the associated information about me. The image of my most recent (and only) completed project will redirect the use to the deployed site. The boxes below will contain older projects as soon as there are more to house which will also redirect to those deployed sites. The contact links redirect to my email and github respectively.
